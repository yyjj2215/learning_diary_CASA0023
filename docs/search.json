It has two types, one is active remote sensing,the other one is passive remote sensing. The difference between them is active remote sensing has a energy source.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between passive and active remote sensing.

The light has to travel further through the Earth’s atmosphere in sunset. The blue light is scattered away, but the red light isn’t scattered very much – so the sky appears red.\n\n\n1.1.4 Four resolutions of remote sensing data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Types\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nspatial resolution\nthe size of the raster grid per pixel\n20cm or 30m\n\n\nspectral resolution\nthe number of bands\nBand 2 - blue (0.45-0.51 wavelength)\n\n\ntemporal resolution\nthe time it revisits\ndaily or every 7 days\n\n\nRadiometric resolution\nthe range of possible values\n8 bit, 12 bit, or 16 bit\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Raster data acquisition\nThere are many sources that provide raster data, for example, raster data can be produced by aerial photography and satellites.

    "text": "1.2 Application\nColor composites are an essential concept in remote sensing. True color composites sometimes refer to the color we recognize in life. For example, the tree canopy is green, and the strawberry is red. The false color composites are to display the real color in other colors. For example, the tree canopy can be displayed as red, and the strawberry can be displayed as green. The false color composites are widely applied in many remote sensing researches.\nOne research was conducted in Afghanistan by U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and it assessed the natural resources of Afghanistan. The following picture is a true color composite. It’s difficult to recognize some of the characteristics in this area., but the False color composite better displays individual strata, allows regional correlations of strata, and better depicts structure, such as anticlines, synclines, and faults(Philip A. (2007)).\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Davis, P. A. 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Davis, P. A. 2007\n\n\n\n\nThe color gun can produce a variety of false color composites. And the second research compares the different combinations of false colors in Pail/Padhrar Area in Punjab Province, Pakistan (Bajwa, Ahsan, and Ahmad (2020)) The table shows the same geological formation can be displayed in various colors in different false color composites. This would be applied to many remote sensing data if we try to identify some specific features.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Bajwa et al. 2020"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nRaster data acquisition\nThe two main raster data acquisition ways are useful for future research, and I can find all raster data all over the world from Sentinel and Landsat. This actually inspires me that I can applied raster data in my final work of GEOG0114 course last term. My original topic is to explore how the thermal inequality affect people’s health in Chicago, but I don’t know where to download raster data and how to manipulate it. Then, I just gave up this topic and selected a new topic, which was doing criminology research. However, I think I’m currently able to analysis raster data in my study by using SNAP, QGIS, and R.\n\n\n\n\n\nResample and mask for Sentinel and Landsat data of Cape Town in south Africa Source: Yanbo\n\n\n\n\nSpectral signature\nI think this content will be useful for me to better understand the applications of remote sensing data. Spectral signature is the variations of reflectance and absorption for different materials in various wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical spectral signatures of specic land cover type Source: Anna 2017\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure provides a very good example for explanation. I can easily identify different material based on their characteristics of reflectance. For example, when the wavelengths greater than 700nm, the reflectance of green vegetation increases from 10% to 50%, this is also called red edge. This is really essential for identify green vegetation in real application and distinguish different vegetation type because the amount of Chlorophyll are various in different species. In addition, I also can use spectral signature to identify different type of materials, like explore where is the urban area, agriculture, bare land, and so on.\nColor composites\nThis concept is very interesting because I think many people have cognition that tree leaves are green, and flower is colorful. Also, in our phone, they are also displayed as the same color that we recognize in life. If they are displayed into different colors, it comes very interesting things. For example, I can use false color composites to create image has purple or pink leaves if I want. In addition, false composites are essential for remote sensing data because they can show more characteristics in the image compared to true color composites. This has been discussed in the application part, and I think I also can apply false color composites in my future study.\n\n\n\n\nBajwa, Rizwan Saqib, Naveed Ahsan, and Sajid Rashid Ahmad. 2020. “A Review of Landsat False Color Composite Images for Lithological Mapping of Pre-Cambrian to Recent Rocks: A Case Study of Pail/Padhrar Area in Punjab Province, Pakistan.” Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing 48 (5): 721–28. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12524-019-01090-7.\n\n\nPhilip A., Davis. 2007. “Landsat ETM+ False-Color Image Mosaics of Afghanistan.”"

    "text": "3.2 Application\nExplorations of radiometric calibration methods in UAS data\nThere are many methods for radiometric calibration. Generally, when you have some remote sensing data, image producers will have some recommended methods, but there are also some empirical methods. One research had compared five common methods by using unmanned aircraft systems data, which tries to explore the best performance of radiometric calibration. The five methods are one-point calibration (method A), one-point calibration plus sunshine sensor (method B), pre-calibration using the simplified empirical line calibration (method C) , one-point calibration plus sunshine sensor plus post-calibration(method D), and post-calibration using the simplified empirical line calibration (method E). The paper found there are no method that can have the best performance in every band Poncet et al.

For example, method B has lower RMSE in red-edge and NIR, but higher in green band. So we need to select the suitable method for radiometric calibration depending on our objectives Poncet et al. (2019b). The analysis of imagery data can be more careful because the radiometric calibration method may have influence on the interpretation of UAS imagery.\nEffects of Atmospheric Corrections on NDVI\nVegetation measurement is an essential application in remote sensing, and NDVI is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which can quantify vegetation health. For example, when NDVI values are close to +1, the vegetation should be dense green, and when NDVI values are close to 0, there are no green. The NDVI formula is following:\n\n\n\n\n\nNDVI formula: GISGeography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNDVI values Source: GISGeography\n\n\n\n\nOne study explored common methods (QUAC, FLAASH, DOS, ACOLITE, 6S, and Sen2Cor) for atmospheric Corrections on NDVI by using Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and UAV sensors data. In real raster data analysis, data probably are from different source, so the atmospheric correction, to some extent, make them more comparable. In this paper, FLAASH method has the best distinctiveness on NDVI between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. Moravec et al.

This contributes to reduce the dimensionality of data. In real remote sensing data analysis, I think the data probably have multiple dimensions, and the PCA would be functional to reduce them, which help us identify which components are more important among the data.

My proposal tries to generate some detailed solutions for environmental goals and policies, which contribute to the health and sustainability of the natural environment in Seattle.\nGoal\nENG1: Foster healthy trees, vegetation, and soils to improve human health, provide wildlife habitats, improve drainage, give residents across the city access to nature, provide fresh food, and increase the quality of life for all Seattleites.\nPolices\nEN 1.1: Seek to achieve an urban forest that contains a thriving and sustainable mix of tree species and ages, and that creates a contiguous and healthy ecosystem that is valued and cared for by the City and all Seattleites as an essential environmental, economic, and community asset. \nEN 1.2: Strive to increase citywide tree canopy coverage to 30 percent by 2037 and to 40 percent over time. \nEN 1.3: Use trees, vegetation, green stormwater infrastructure, amended soil, green roofs, and other low-impact development features to meet drainage needs and reduce the impacts of development. \nSeattle policy link: https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPCD/OngoingInitiatives/SeattlesComprehensivePlan/CouncilAdopted2020.pdf"

In order to improve tree canopy cover in Seattle, I think two steps are necessary, and they should be detailed.\n\nexplore the neighborhoods with a high preferablity of planting tree\nidentify the potential planting site in areas with a high priority of tree planting\n\nIn this application, I tries to review some literature and generate some detailed solutions for increasing canopy cover and urban forest, which contribute and support to the health and sustainability of the natural environment in Seattle.\nNeighborhood level: Preferable locations analysis of urban tree planting\nThe study conducted by Locke et al. (2010) analyzed the preferable locations of urban tree planting in New York City, they narrowed the preferable locations to the neighborhood levels. Although the data they used is not remote sensing data, the method of identifying the preferable locations of urban trees are also useful for Seattle. They used need-based criteria for preferability analysis. For example, when some neighborhood with a higher temperature in summer, it would be a high priority area for planting a tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of variables in preferablity analysis. Source: Locke et al., 2010\n\n\n\n\nThey combined many variables together, and assigned the different weights based on the importance of variables. Finally, they produced a map that shows neighborhoods with different priority for planting trees.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritization map of planting trees.

It can iterativelly find the potential planting areas, and this would be really useful for planting department in every city. The planting department can combine the virtually planting sites with the real site conditions to plant a new tree for city.\ndata\n\nsource：QuickBird satellite\nspatial resolution: 2.4m\nbands: blue, green, red, near-infrared , and a panchromatic band with 60cm\ntemporal resolution: 64 scenes collected from 2002 to 2005\n\nMethod\nThe computer program iterativelly search all the potential planting site, and it will avoid areas that are not suitable to plant trees, like sites too close to the buildings, pavings and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart of tree planting.

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nI think I need to always consider the policies and goals in the application of remote sensing data. The remote sensing data are not only limited in doing research, but also contributed to the development of cities. This will provide a positive loop in both remote sensing development and city development. Also, the policy about increasing green canopy is proposed by many cities, and this would be a great research direction for me. \nThe policies not only have limitations on how to achieve the policies, but also they should provide some detailed guides about tree and vegetation species for citizens. This will engage more citizens to join the planting work, and they may plant more trees in their gardens. It also can avoid some potential risks in the tree planting process. There are many invasive plants in North America, people usually have a high possibility to plant a wrong plant that causes plant invasion.\nThe two cases in the application part only considered the new planting trees. The management and monitoring of existing trees also essential for the achivment of goals and policies. For example, some LiDAR data can be used to detect the height of trees, and also monitoring the tree health. Unhealthy trees can be treated or replaced.\nThe financial part of the implementation of the solution is not considered, and it’s also important for the city of Seattle. The cost of this solution may cause by acquisition of remote sensing data, the implementation of planting trees including planting workers, the costs of nursery trees, and maintenance fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocke, Dexter H., J.
