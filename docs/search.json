    "text": "1.2 Application\nColor composites are an essential concept in remote sensing. True color composites sometimes refer to the color we recognize in life. For example, the tree canopy is green, and the strawberry is red. The false color composites are to display the real color in other colors. For example, the tree canopy can be displayed as red, and the strawberry can be displayed as green. The false color composites are widely applied in many remote sensing researches.\nOne research was conducted in Afghanistan by U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and it assessed of the natural resources of Afghanistan. The following picture is a true color composite. It’s difficult to recognize some of the characteristics in this area., but the False color composite better displays individual strata, allows regional correlations of strata, and better depicts structure, such as anticlines, synclines, and faults(Philip A. (2007)).\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Davis, P. A. 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Davis, P. A. 2007\n\n\n\n\nThe color gun can produce a variety of false color composites. And the second research compares the different combinations of false colors in Pail/Padhrar Area in Punjab Province, Pakistan (Bajwa, Ahsan, and Ahmad (2020)) The table shows the same geological formation can be displayed in various colors in different false color composites. This would be applied to many remote sensing data if we try to identify some specific features.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Bajwa et al. 2020"
