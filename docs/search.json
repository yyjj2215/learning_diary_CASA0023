The difference between them is active remote sensing has a energy source.\n\n\n\n[Differences between passive and active remote sensing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339726853_The_Mexican_Water_Forest_benefits_of_using_remote_sensing_techniques_to_assess_changes_in_land_use_and_land_cover)\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Electromagentic waves\npropagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy.\n\n\n\nElectromagentice waves.
