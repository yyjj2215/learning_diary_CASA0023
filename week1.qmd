# Week1 Getting started with remote sensing

## Summary

### what is remote sensing?

Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). It has two types, one is active remote sensing,the other one is passive remote sensing. The difference between them is active remote sensing has a energy source.

### Electromagentic waves

propagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy.

### Interactions with atmosphere and earth's surface

+-------------+------------------------+-------------------------------------+
|             | Atmosphere             | Earth's suface                      |
+=============+========================+=====================================+
| Interaction | scattered by particles | -   absorbed by the surface         |
|             |                        |                                     |
|             |                        | -   transmitted through the surface |

Scattering has three types:

a\) Raleigh and Mie

```

b\) non-selective

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE, fig.cap= "Source: [Natural Resources Canada](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-publications/satellite-imagery-air-photos/remote-sensing-tutorials/introduction/interactions-atmosphere/14635)"}

***Raleigh scattering(Why sky is blue? and sunset is red?)***

Blue light is scattered more than red light so the sky appears blue. The light has to travel further through the Earth's atmosphere in sunset. The blue light is scattered away, but the red light isn't scattered very much -- so the sky appears red.

### Four resolutions of remote sensing data

| Resolution Types       | Description                           | Examples                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| spatial resolution     | the size of the raster grid per pixel | 20cm or 30m                          |
| spectral resolution    | the number of bands                   | Band 2 - blue (0.45-0.51 wavelength) |
| temporal resolution    | the time it revisits                  | daily or every 7 days                |
| Radiometric resolution | the range of possible values          | 8 bit, 12 bit, or 16 bit             |

## Application

Color composites are an essential concept in remote sensing. True color composites sometimes refer to the color we recognize in life. For example, the tree canopy is green, and the strawberry is red. The false color composites are to display the real color in other colors. For example, the tree canopy can be displayed as red, and the strawberry can be displayed as green. The false color composites are widely applied in many remote sensing researches.

One research was conducted in Afghanistan by U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and it assessed of the natural resources of Afghanistan. The following picture is a true color composite. It's difficult to recognize some of the characteristics in this area., but the False color composite better displays individual strata, allows regional correlations of strata, and better depicts structure, such as anticlines, synclines, and faults(@philipa.2007).

```

The color gun can produce a variety of false color composites. And the second research compares the different combinations of false colors in Pail/Padhrar Area in Punjab Province, Pakistan (@bajwa2020) The table shows the same geological formation can be displayed in various colors in different false color composites. This would be applied to many remote sensing data if we try to identify some specific features.
